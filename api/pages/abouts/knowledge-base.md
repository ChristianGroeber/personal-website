# About My Knowledge Base

This project has come a long ways! It all started when I discovered [pico cms](https://picocms.org/)
in 2019, and I was immediately intrigued by it. The simplicity of having everything stored in plain-text files,
no database required... I was hooked.

There was one major flaw though.

No way to edit the content without opening the files in a text editor.

Thus began my work to integrate a full editor into Pico.

Now, the first few revisions were absolutely terrible, a huge unreadable mess... But it's now come a long way,
and I've created a framework out of it, and even a CMS using that framework... and this site is the first thing
I built on top of the CMS.

I like to think of it as an editor for your brain (if your brain is written in markdown).
