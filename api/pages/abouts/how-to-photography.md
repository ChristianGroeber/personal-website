## The heck am I looking at?
This is the first ever website I created, using only HTML and CSS. 

I had realised that I needed some way to load parts of the website (like the header) dynamically, so that it wouldn't have to be added into every single HTML file. I achieved this by using one line of Javascript:

`<script>document.getElementById("links").innerHTML='<object style="width:55px; height:165px;" type="text/html" data="000700.html"></object>';</script>`
(Although it did the job, it threw all styling completely out of the window and had to maticulously be redone). 

While this by no standard holds up to how a website should look and behave nowadays, I still am quite proud of it, just for the virtue of all the work that I put into it. It isn't responsive at all, so to allow it to be viewed on mobile devices, I created an exact copy of the desktop version, which would then be opened. 

I created a naming scheme for all files, where each file had 6 numbers, the first one telling the version, 0 for mobile, 1 for desktop, the second number was for the language, 0 for german, 1 for english...

## Conclusion
This website should in no way be taken as a reference for my quality of work right now, but it neatly shows where I come from, and I always fell nostalgic looking at it again. So, I'm happy there's some way for me to present it to the public through this.
